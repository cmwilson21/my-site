      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Courtney. I live in Tennessee. It’s a pretty great place. I’d really love to travel, though. I was hoping to do some international traveling in 2020, but the joke was on me. My plans have been put on hold until there is no longer an active global pandemic. Until then, I’ll keep watching travel shows!</p>

      <h2>My Journey in Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>I’m pretty new to this software engineering world, but I’m loving it so far. It’s a big challenge, but I’m up for it. It’s time to make a change in my life, so here we go. I’m not super awesome at any of it yet, but I’ll get there. Check back with me from time to time to see other pages and watch as my skills improve. Until then, enjoy this basic personal page.</p>
